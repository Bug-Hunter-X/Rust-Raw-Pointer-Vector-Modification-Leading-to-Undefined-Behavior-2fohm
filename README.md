This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and vector manipulation.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code that attempts to modify a vector using a raw pointer, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer and more idiomatic approach.  This is a critical issue for anyone working with lower-level memory management in Rust.
